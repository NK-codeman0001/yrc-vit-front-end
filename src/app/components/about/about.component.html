  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>Youth Red Cross (YRC) is one of the biggest and most active clubs and a non- profitable organization and voluntary service body in VIT functioning since July, 1999. YRC VIT, with its mission of protection of health and life, service to humanity, promotion of national and international friendship, and to develop the mental and moral capacities of the youth, promises to provide humanitarian services to the fellow human beings.</p>
